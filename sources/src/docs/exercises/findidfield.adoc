*Find the ID field and id field extractor*

Suppose you have a bunch of entity classes for which you want to create something like
a DAO. That DAO would be greatly helped if you could reflect over the entity class
and find the name of the id field and its getter.


.Mapper usage in client code
[source,java]
----
 // register a mapper for student entities. Do it once after app start.
 mapperRegistery.add(Student.class, new EntityMapper<Student>(Student.class));

  .
  .
 // Create a fresh dao whenever you need one, like getting student jan from storage.
    DAO<Student,Integer> sdaon = daoFactory.createDao(Student.class);
    Integer snummer = 122345;
    Student jan = sdao.get(snummer);
----

.Mapper usage in the DAO.
[source,java]
----

   EntityMapper<E,K> mapper = mapperRegistry.get( entityType );

   String sql ="select * from "
   DAO<Student,Integer> sdaon = daoFactory.createDao(Student.class);

   Integer snummer = 122345;
   Student jan = sdao.get(snummer);
----

Note that the implementation can use  a class, that saves the found information,
so that reflection does not have to take place on every access, which would make things really slow.


Your task is to implement the EntityMapper the following methods.

[source,java]
----
   /**
    * Function to extract the primary key or ID field from the entity.
    * The returned function will be used as.
    */
   Function<E,K> keyextractor(); // <1>

    /**
     * Get the name of the id field.
     */
   String idName();  // <2>
----

<1> This method may return a method reference.
