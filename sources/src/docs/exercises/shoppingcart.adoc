*Shopping Cart*

The shopping cart exercise is about working with interfaces and exceptions.

//Task description link:../pdf/shoppingcart.pdf[Shopping cart].

You model a shopping cart. It is a simplified model of a web shop.

The cart contains items. Items have name and price.
The shopping car stores the items in a hash map that maps items to
integer amounts.
The hash map allows lookup of the items in the cart.

The cart computes the total price of the contained items.
The cart also has a special price calculator that allows the shop to
implement actions like one bubble gum when you take two bottles of
cola.

The Item and the ShoppingCart are defined as interfaces.
Each has an implementing class. These classes are provided to you and
you have to write the tests and the implementation.

The class diagram of this library is given below.

*Way of working*

. Determine the order in which you will test your classes and methods.
. For each method that is to be implemented, write the test
  first.
. Commit this test as soon as it is written. Use 'test xxx
  written' as commit log.
. Implement the method you want to test. If the method satisfies
  the test, commit it. use 'method xxx implemented and tested' as
  commit log.

*The design*
In figure below you find the class diagram of the
whole package.

Inside the sources you find the documentation.
If you are more comfortable reading html, generate the javadoc.
