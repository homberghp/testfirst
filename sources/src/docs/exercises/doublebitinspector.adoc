== Java FX Double-Bit Inspector

You will be making a tiny tool to
inspect doubles at the bit level.

The final UI will look like this, and is provided, because
it would take much time to recreate, and the focus in this exercise is on bindings.

*Double Bits, Bind along*

In this assignment you will use the knowledge you acquired on how
doubles are stored as bits and how to use binding and *JavaFX* to make a
GUI that allows the user to fiddle with the bits.

Our initial prototype is presented in figure<<_final_UI, Final UI>>.

*Hints for the implementation*

You should study the bindings once more. See the PRC2 website and the
links over there. In this assignment, the 'Low-Level' binding is
probably your friend, because you want to extract parts of the bit
sequence and present it as an integer, in case you want to create a
representation of the exponent  field of a double.

If you think of bindings, think of JavaFX properties.

You might also want to use *bidirectional* bindings, for instance between
the `textProperty()` of your input field and the double
bits' internal double or long value.

Some bindings may have to be implemented by hand. If so, think of
*change~ or invalidation listener* concept.

* Double, huh?*

In case you forgot, the IEEE 754  standard for floating point and
double can be summarized as

* A double uses 64 bits, 52 for the mantissa, 11 bits for the
  (biased) exponent and 1 bit for the sign.
* The bias in the exponent is 1023, so the value 1.0D has the bit
  patterns (starting from the left) 2 zeros, then 10 ones and then 52
  zeros.
* The double value 0.0D has all bits equal to zero.
* To get access to the double bits, you first need to get them as
  a long (not with a cast but rather with the static method
  `long Double.doubleToRawLongBits(double d)`). Fiddling with the
  bits of a long is allowed.
* There is also a reverse operation double
  `Double.longBitsToDouble(long bits)`.
* The exponent can be isolated with +
  `int e = (int)((bits >> 52) & 0x7ffL);` +
