== Template Engine: Text processing with state machines.

Use case: Think serial mail or mail merge or something similar.

The code is also a kind of template, you need to fill in the empty spots, like in an assessment.

There will be talk about *sigil*, a magic sign. In the example we use two: +
'{{'  as starter and '}}' as terminator,
but the solution is flexible enough to take any other pair you like. Sigil stands for the character or character-sequence
given and is there to make parsing of template text easier. By choosing a proper set, they will not handicap what you can write in your template text.
The defaults are quite reasonable.
And if you do, you can always *escape*.

*Use case and idea* +
This exercise is about a simple templating engine.

Its usecase is a typical serial letter generator. This comes in handy when
you want to send 'personalised' emails to students. A seasoned
informatics person knows you should not use `eval(...)` for
that, because that will potentially execute any code.

Say you have some text and you want to substitute certain words with
something from a data source, such as student names and/or
grades. Then you could embellish the text with special tokens called
sigils (magic signs) that help to find the words to be substituted. An
example may help:

[source,text]
----
Dear {{teacher}},

We would like to complain about the module {{mod}}.
We learn to little and the examples are way too trivial.
We would like to receive our moneys worth of teaching.
Kind regards,
The students.
----

In the example the magic signs are the `{{` and `}}` sequences, anything in
between is understood as key in the map, and when found, replaced by
the mapped value.

.If the map is filled like:
[source,java]
----
Map<Object, String> map = Map.of(
        "teacher", "Richard van den Ham",
        "mod", "Programming Concepts 2 (PRC2)"
);
----

.Then the engine can be created and started as
[source,java]
----
Function<String, String> lookup = ( s ) -> map.getOrDefault( s, "" );
// write to file.
new Engine( "{{", "}}", lookup )
        .reading( "letter.txt" )
        .writing( "mail-out.txt" )
        .run();
----

This program will print to a the file name 'mail-out.txt'.

.sample output
[source,text]
----
Dear Richard van den Ham,

We would like to complain about the module Programming Concepts 2 (PRC2).
We learn too little and the examples are way too trivial.
Kind regards,
The students.

*Design*

The design is about a simple state machine with five states. See figure <<states>>.


In addition the "templating engine" has two helper classes, a `SigilMatcher` and the `enum TemplateState`. See the
<<class-diagram>> These classes are package private and so are the methods in them.

The methods you use to configure the engine, constructors, the
`readingXXX(...)`, and
`writing(...)` are part of a so called *fluent* API. They, plus the
`accept(int)` and `run()` methods are the only methods that are
part of the public API.

Given the sigils as above, the Test data in the EngineTest test class are:

.test data
[source,java]
----
static Stream<ET> getTestValues() {
    // we use a helper class ET to collect strings into a engine test data object.
    ET[] testData = new ET[]{
                et( "{{", "}}", '\\', "hello {{world}}...", "hello Schöne Heimat...",
                "world", "Schöne Heimat" ),
                et( "{{", "}}", '\\', "hello {{süßes}}", "hello Schöne Heimat", "süßes", "Schöne Heimat" ),
                et( "{{", "}}", '\\', "now somethings with {{two}} words to {{replace}}", // template
                "now somethings with more words to work with", // expected
                "two", "more", //  kv 1
                "replace", "work with" // kv 2
                ),
                et( "{{", "}}", '\\', "Niks geen substituties", "Niks geen substituties" ),
                et( "{{", "}}", '\\', "Leave me {alone}}", "Leave me {alone}}" ), // incomplete starter
                et( "{{", "}}", '\\', "Leave me { {alone}}", "Leave me { {alone}}" ), // broken starter
                et( "{{", "}}", '\\', "Leave me {{alone}, go away", "Leave me {{alone}, go away" ), // broken postfix
                et( "{{", "}}", '\\', "Leave me {{alone}}, go away I am Broken at the {{Tail}",
                "Leave me , go away I am Broken at the {{Tail}" ), // broken postfix at tail
                // text below for escaping version only.
                // Note the duplication of the \ char to make the strings valid Java strings.
                et( "{{", "}}", '\\', "Look ma, this is how you write a sigil"
                + " text in your letter: \\{{my dear boy}}"
                + " and I used \\\\ to write this example",
                "Look ma, this is how you write a sigil"
                + " text in your letter: {{my dear boy}}"
                + " and I used \\ to write this example",
                "not used", "not used either" // kv1
                ),
                // below different sigil lengths, 1 and 3.
                et( "{", "}", '\\', "hello single char template {world}...", "hello single char template Schöne Heimat...",
                "world", "Schöne Heimat" ),
                et( "{{{", "}}}", '@',
                "And it works with three and other escape as well."
                + "text in your letter: {{{my dear boy}}}.",
                "And it works with three and other escape as well."
                + "text in your letter: well, that depends.",
                "my dear boy", "well, that depends" ), // kv1
            };
    return Arrays.stream( testData );
}

*Your Task.*

The sigil matcher is complete, tested and implemented. It is also a
state full class, however NOT using the state pattern, but simply
counting the characters matched. So that implementation will provide
little help in your real task. Sorry.

Implement this design. Develop test driven. (Should be easy. The test data are already waiting in the code).

. Implement the `reading` method in `Engine`.
. You only need to complete the `testEngine` method in the `EngineTest` test class.
. Implement the state machine in the `TemplateState` class, 
see the <<states>>.

Look for the todo's with kbd:[CTRL+6] in NetBeans IDE.


*Hints* +
A statemachine reacts to 'events' or method calls.

* The functions in java.util.function have no member that processes chars. The reason for that is
that in many case chars can be processed as ints. Also, when retrieving the character elements from a CharSequence (an interface implemented by the java.lang.String class)
using either the method `IntStream chars()` or `IntStream codePoints()` will produce an `intStream`. For the processing part that is just fine. One needs only to remember
to cast the values to `char`s when writing them to the output.
* In this state machine the event of importance
  is the invocation of the method `Engine.accept(int char)`, which is stipulated by the `IntConsumer` functional interface.
* The Engine provides an accept(int) method that matches the `IntConsumer` functional interface.
  This means  that is the engine is fed one character at the time. You can use that method as a method reference (`this::accept`) or a lambda expression.
  (`(c) -> accept(c)`).
* To use a file with text as input template you will have to turn that file into many accept calls.
** Think of streams, and use the method `Files.lines()`, study what
  *flatMap* and *flatMapToInt* is all about and use it to get the result: from
  stream of strings to stream of int, one int per character of the string. In the String API you have two options. Either one will do in most cases.
* Make a drawing (pencil, paper). `Files.line` produces a stream, the Engine puts
  itself at the end, consuming the stream of `int`s. You have to tie
  these parts together.

In the class diagram of engine substitute Engine for the T in the `ObjIntConsumer<T>`. +
Remember that an ObjIntConsumer takes two inputs and produces no direct return value. State Pattern in action with a twist of enum thrown in.

[TIP]
====
There is a difference between the state machine diagram on this website and in the source folder in the project.
The diagram on this website should take precedence, because this is how we test it now.
The difference actually only affects the way wrongly formatted template documents are handled, so the choice is arbitrary. In the
design in this website, the 'junk' is output, in the other it is discarded. Showing the junk may help the user to find the error
in the template earlier. A more professional variant might produce some diagnostics, but we left that out of the exercise.
