== Kaos at HQ

//include::../homelink.adoc[]

Intro into the value of testing, and why test first and not afterwards. +

Kaos shows a stupid way of implementing something in a non test driven fashion. The resulting code
is really bad and only partially tested. If fact the tests were written afterwards, because who is to know anyway?

[TIP]
====
Do not get inspired by the code or the test code you see here. It is bad on almost every front, and serves only as example
to how bad things can get when NOT done Test Driven
