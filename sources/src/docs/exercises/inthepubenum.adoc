*In the pub Enum*

For this exercise, you are again expanding on the exercise from last week.
Amend the pub simulation by turning the volume of a drink into an `enum`.  *Work test driven!* for the parts that you add.

This is also a refactoring exercise, so you start out by copying the source and test classes for the week 1 in the pub exercise.

Youâ€™ll find the project template in your repository. This time, the project is mostly empty packages.
Copy over your code from last week to continue here. Remember to write the tests to test the `enum` class. +
After that the project should have the same package structure as the original. Keep you solution  for week 1 intact and
only modify the code in this weeks project.

. Beer can be either of size SMALL (0.2L), LARGE (1.0L) or PINT (0.57L)
. The Enum should contain exactly 3 values (small, large, pint), not more not less.
