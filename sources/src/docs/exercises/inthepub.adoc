*In the pub*

For this exercise, you are modeling and implementing the process of drinking beer in a pub.
 Develop your own pub simulation. Write unit tests to test if your implementation works and
 if it conforms to the specification and if exceptions are properly handled. *Work test driven!*

Youâ€™ll find the project template in your repository.

_Here are the specifications of this exercise. Turn them into *testable requirements* before you start your TDD process._

. Initially the pub has 100L of beer available.
. A barkeeper and beer drinkers belong to a Pub.
. Beer drinkers can ask the barkeeper for beer.
. Beer is handed out either in small format (0.2L) or pint format (0.57L).
. Beer drinkers can only drink a limited amount of beer, between 2L and 5L.

Here is how you could start the BarkeeperTest class. First you create a barkeeper that you use in your tests.
[source,java]
----
    private Barkeeper barkeeper;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        barkeeper = new Barkeeper();
    }
----

In your first test method, you want to test whether the tapping of beer works as intended. Let the test fail first,
then implement the logic of that test. When you have finished,continue to the next part.

The exercise is finished when you have tested and implemented each requirement.
