This exercise is about bindings and a bit about a JavaFX toy clock.

. ticker helper
. the java fx clock

You will also learn how to combine maven projects into one final result.

You should build the projects in order.

The toy clock will look like the thing in the picture.

.BB8 as a clock face

Youâ€™ll program a clock like this, including all its functionality and
both the digital as well as the analog display, step by step.


The clock's operation mimics a mechanical clock, driven
by a synchronous electric motor, which drives the right hand time
element which in turn drives the element on  its left and so on.

*Tasks*

Start by answering the questions below in a README.md file inside the
maven project, at the same level as the pom.xml file.


You can also take notes there, to keep things in one place.

. What are functions available in this design?
.. Think of display(s), buttons and what time means.
.. Describe these functions.
.. Is there any interaction between the elements in the display?

. Describe how you would thoroughly test this device.


The project has two maven projects: *TickerHelper* and the *fxclockstart*.

Build the javadoc of the TickerHelper library and study it to see how it can be used.

* Complete the unit tests in TimeElementTest to test your time-element implementation.
* Add seconds and days: Make sure that your clock registers days, hours,
  minutes and seconds too.
* Consider your implementation and check if it is DRY (*D*on't
  *R*epeat *Y*ourselves).

Note to use the *fx*- profile when building and running the fxclock project.

*JavaDoc*

The link:{exercises}/tickerhelper/apidocs/index.html[javadoc of ticker helper]
 and the of the application  link:{exercises}/fxclock/apidocs/index.html[fxclock javadoc]
 and link:{exercises}/fxclock/testapidocs/index.html[fxclock test javadoc] are available by following the links.

*Corrections to the start project code*

[WARNING]
Due to the way the FXMLLoader works, having incorrect or incomplete code in the
*controller* class will throw exceptions that are not very helpful to say the least.

That the students experience this problem has to do with the fact that
we make the code incomplete on purpose, to give you some work :-). +
However, our quality checks where not properly in place, so there you have it.


To avoid this problem,

* you can _comment_ out some of the given code (which *IS* needed for the complete solution)
* and re-enable (uncomment) it once your controller is complete and has its fields both declared and properly initialised.

Code to temporarily comment out:

.comment in method clockWork
[source,java]
----
  private void clockWork() {
//      second.increment();
  }
----


.comment in method setupAlarm
[source,java]
----
 private void setupAlarm() {
        ahourLabel.opacityProperty().bind( alarmOpacity );
        aminuteLabel.opacityProperty().bind( alarmOpacity );
        ahourSep.opacityProperty().bind( alarmOpacity );
////// comment to make it work with missing field initialisations
//      setPerspective();
//      alarmTimeReached = ahour.valueProperty()
//            .isEqualTo( hour.valueProperty() ).and( aminute.valueProperty()
//            .isEqualTo( minute.valueProperty() ) );
//       alarmTimeReached.addListener( this::soundAlarm );
 }
