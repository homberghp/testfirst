=== Exercise Flawless Password

++++
<div class='ex'><details class='ex' open><summary class='ex'>Flawless passwords</summary>
++++

Whenever you register an account somewhere, you are asked to create a password. Usually, this
password needs to adhere to a certain standard such as a minimum of eight characters or at least one uppercase
letter, a special character such as ampersand (&), star (*), dash (-) or exclamation marks (!).

In this exercise, you have to write methods that validate a password. For example, one
method checks whether the password contains an uppercase letter. Remember to start writing
the tests first! The password should follow these rules:

* be at least 10 characters long.
* contain at least one *uppercase letter*.
* contain at least one *lowercase letter*.
* contain at least one *digit*.
* contain at least one *special character*, defined as NOT a letter and not a digit.

When all requirements are met, the password will not be blank, so that needs no separate encoding.

The list of special characters in ASCII is `!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~` and +`+.
I found that out with the little program `validator.SpecialChars`. It chooses all ASCII characters between character number 33 (space+1).
and 127, excluding those that qualify as letters aor digits.

The java Character class has quite a few `static` methods to check if a character classifies as a certain kind of character. For instance
`Character.isDigit('9')`  will return `true` as will  `Character.isUpper('Ã„')`.

The design you are going to implement is using a so called *FlawSet*, a set of flaws or missing requirements.
This uses the approach of _elimination_. In this case elimination of flaws or missing requirements.

Each Flaw is modeled as a value of the `enum` `Flaw` which according to the requirements has 5 values.
Each value has a description on what the flaw is, and a character to encode the flaws as a short string. This is helpful in testing as you will see.

In the validator we create a set of flaws and fill it with all possible flaws. If a requirement is met, the flaw (not meeting the requirement)
can be removed from the set. If the set is empty, because all potential flaws have been removed, you know that the subject of the flaw tests meets all requirements.
It is *flawless*.

The FlawSet is modeled using an EnumSet. An EnumSet is an implementation of a set with the member type an [blue]#enum# of some sort, the Flaw [blue]#enum# in our case.
An EnumSet is a very space efficient and fast set implementation. +
Study *Horstmann Vol I Section 9.4.6* and  https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/EnumSet.html[EnumSet api].

The validator test should be set up using a parameterized test, using a CsvSource, in which each line contains a password and the set of flaws that it has.
To avoid too long texts in in the table we encode each flaw as a single character, which are hopefully mnemonic, to help readability of the test method.
For instance *'U'* means missing upper case, *'l'* missing lower case.
This is the encoding character in the Flaw enum.

The Flaw enum has two convenience methods, which you can use as is.

. `static EnumSet<Flaw> stringToFlawSet( String encoding )` that takes a String and returns a FlawSet that goes with it.
. `static Flaw encodingToFlaw( char encoding )` that returns a Flaw value dependent on its encoding character.

<1> Do not worry if you do not understand this immediately, the details will follow starting week 4 or 5.
<2> Hey, still reading? You seem interested. This converts the int stream into an object stream of enum values.
<3> We do not want null values. Might happen when an encoding is not valid.
<4> Then collect it into a collection, in the specific case an `EnumSet` of `Flaw` values. We start with the empty set, which will
be filled with the values resulting from the stream. +
Note that we left out the imports.


The `Flaw` enum and it's test are already in the project. I can't hurt to study the tests.

.encoding table
[cols="50,100", options="header"]
|====
| encoding | Flaw
| 'U'      | No UPPER case letter
| 'l'      | No lower case letter
| '8'      | No digit
| '#'      | No special character
| 's'      | Too short
|====

Write two tests,

. *invalidPassword* that checks for [red]*invalid* passwords as `@ParameterizedTest` which uses a table of invalid password and the encoding of the flaws to detect.
. *validPassword* that accepts (one) or two valid passwords. You can also implement that as a `@ParameterizedTest`, but in the one password variant, you can get by
 with a simple unit test method.

First write the test for invalid passwords. Use a `@ParameterizedTest` and a `@CvsSource`.
The test should assert that an exception is thrown and that all desciptions of the found flaws are present in the message.
Make sure you have a csv test line for each of the failure cases, but also test for passwords that have multiple flaws.
Best is to write all the invalid password and their encodings, but comment out the ones you are not yet testing.

The csv records should contain two values, a flawed password and the encoded flaws.
Example `"'password',U8#s"` because the password does not contain digits, UPPER case, nor special characters, and is too short, the encoded flaws are `U8#s`.
You can apply the trick to _split_ with an empty string to get the encodings as 1 character string. Or you can stream the encoding with String.
Note that the order of the encoding characters should not matter, but proper coding style might say write them consistently in definition- or alphabetical order.
Choice is up to you. We chose the former.

When the password is invalid, throw an `IllegalPasswordException` with a message that contains the descriptions of all flaws found.

The idea of the validator method is that you initially fill an EnumSet with all possible flaw values, which is very easy: `EnumSet.allOf( Flaw.class )`.
Then for every character of the password check,
check if it fulfills a requirement. If it does, you can eliminate the corresponding Flaw from the set.
See the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/EnumSet.html[EnumSet ^]
or https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html[Set ^] API on how to do that.
Once you have used up all the characters in the password, check if the set is empty.
If it is, the password meets it's requirement and is flaw[green]**less**; +
if not, the set contains the requirements [red]*not* fulfilled and the password is to be considered flawed.
