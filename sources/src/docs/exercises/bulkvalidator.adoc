== Bulk validator

Quite often when dealing with user input, validation has to be done.
This validation is often repetitious work for the programmer.
How about validating all inputs of a form in one go, and at the same time apply necessary conversions.

The *bulkvalidator* project is exactly fit for this purpose.
It takes all inputs as a map, validates _and_ converts (e.g. parses to `Integer`, `double`, `long`, `LocalDate` etc.)
and returns them as result.

While checking the validity of the values in the input map, it checks for correctness.
In the inner loop, it catches and collects the exceptions that can occur when a validation fails.

.Usage of the collecting validator: (Derived from the test code)
[source,java]
----
class BusinessLogic {

  static BulkValidator bv = new BulkValidator().addValidations( //<1>
      Map.of( "customer.id", ( String s ) -> Integer.valueOf( s ),
        "customer.someInt",
            validateWith( Integer::valueOf,
                  BusinessException::new, "Invalid integer" ),
        "customer.dob", LocalDate::parse,
        "customer.postcode", BusinessLogic::validatePC
      )
  );

  void submit( Map<String,String> inputs ) throws BulkException { // <2>
      Map<String,Object> validInputs=bv.validate( inputs );
      process( validInputs );  // <3>
  }

  private void process(Map<String,Object> validInputs) {  // <4>
    // use inputs. With a mapper and some
    customer = new Customer( validInputs.get( "name" ), validInputs.get( "dob" ));
    // do something with customer.
  }
}
----

<1> Give the validator validation rules. You typically do that only once per client class, like the customer controller.
<2> This method will fail with an exception if validation fails.
<3> Validate, but notice that when an error occurs, the submit method stops with a [blue]`BulkException`, which is passed to the caller, typically
    a GUI class in a JavaFX app. +
   If the validation runs without issues, process the result, which are now valid key-value pairs.
<4> Do the normal processing on the now known to be correct values.


Bulk validation can be used in any form based UI, where you collect the data from the UI Controller.
In a JavaFX based project that would be a JavaFX controller, such as a CustomerController.

.Example use in JavaFX GUI, FX controller side
[source,java]
----
    // injected logic
    final BusinessLogic bl;

    FXUIScraper scraper = () -> root; //<1>
    @FXML
    private void submit( ActionEvent event ) { //<2>
        Map<String, String> keyValues = scraper.getKeyValues( x -> true );
        try {
            bl.submit( keyValues );
        } catch ( BulkException bex ) { //<3>
            displayerrors( bex );
        }
    }

    /**
     * The exception passed in contains a map with name of the failing controls
     * and the exception thrown.
     * @param bex exception information
     */
    void displayerrors( BulkException bex ) {
        Map<String, Throwable> causes = bex.getCauses();
        // do something smart with the map, like asking for cause of problem
        // maybe get internionalized message
        // maybe change style or toiltip of the control.
    }

<1> https://javabits.fontysvenlo.org/fxuiscraper/apidocs/nl.homberghp.fxuiscraper/nl/homberghp/fxuiscraper/package-summary.html[FXUIScraper] is a small library that can be used as companion to the BulkValidator.
  It is a dependency in the BulkValidator project and there is testcode too. The project is hosted at https://github.com/homberghp/fxuiscraper[homberghp/fxuiscraper].
<2> The GUI code submits to the business logic, whatever it found when scraping.
<3> When the business code refuses with an exception, update the UI with the error info.

In all cases it is the business code that does the validation, and the UI that does the input collecting and display.
Proper separation of concerns.

[TIP]
====
If compilation does not work because maven can't find a dependency, you may have to change the dependency on genericmapper to version 3.0.2.

The work in the BulkValidator project should be obvious. Complete the test and
implementation code.

The hardest part is in the tests.
Let the IDE guide you. AssertJ is very powerful but as with all haystacks, it is sometimes hard to find
what you want. For instance after you type +

[blue]`assertThatThrownBy(code).isExactlyInstanceOf( BulkException.class )`. +
and  then force completion, you see a whole slew of completions. The ones named [blue]`extractingXXX` open new possibilities.

.completions after `assertThatThrownBy(...)`
image::extracting-completions.png[]

This should be sufficient to complete the puzzle.

Also ensure that the validator logs with level info and that the log messages contain the correct 'words'.




[TIP]
====
[big]*Present* +
In your personal repository you will find two projects, the [black]*BuldValidator* which is
[blue]#this# exercise and a GUI example project, [blue]`bulkexample`, that shows how
this BulkValidator is supposed to be used an can be combined with the [blue]`fxuiscraper`.

There is [big green]*NO* work in the bulkexample project, it only serves as an example.
 It might have relevance for project 2. Enjoy.
