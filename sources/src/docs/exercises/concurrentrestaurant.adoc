*Donald's messy restaurant*

[TIP]
====
The story of a restaurant may sound  a bit silly, but when you think that
the way this works is similar to how a web server works with
multiple clients at the same time, you might accept the purpose of the exercise.

In this execise you will be exploring the effects, both positive (improved throughput) and negative
(add complexity) of running code in _parallel_ and/or _concurrent_.

[TIP]
====
Concurrent and parallel are two distinct ways of modeling. +
*Parallel* is having work done simultaneously, but without interference between the parts of the work. Compare a highway and a normal road.
As long as the traffic does not cross lanes, the throughput of the highway is increased because it can support more traffic per unit of time. +
*Concurrent* is also working simultaneously, but also sharing one or more resources. This means that the workers may interfere with on another,
which is fraught with complexity, same as when crossing lanes on a highway. You must take care not to tread on another driver that currently passes.

*The narative*

Donald has been in the restaurant business for years and is making
  up a plan to provide for a proper pension plan, now he has come into
  the dusk of his famous years and notices he has put up little to
  provide for his elderly years. With the Olympics ahead
  he comes up with a plan to increase his income substantially. To do
  this he adapted his menu to the chinese kitchen (for what he
  thinks Chinese would eat or rather what fellow country ducks would
  enjoy as Chinese food). Completely in style with Chinese restaurant
  usage in the Netherlands, you can order your meal 'by the numbers'.

Donald is not known as the smartest of ducks and his current
  restaurant implementation in Java already has some flaws. As an
  example: the kitchen is very fussy and serves not found when a meal is not on the menu.

*The new employees*

He now wants to be able to serve the customers in parallel, say up to the number of parallel threads your hardware supports
by involving his nephews as employees Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and maybe some more.

*The simulation*

To be prepared, Donald wants to simulate the restaurants behavior
  on his computer. His target is of course to make his employees work as
  efficient as possible, so that he can take care of the till without
  further worries. He wants all employees (threads) to use the restaurant and all the things
  inside in parallel to push more customers through the restaurant in a shorter time.

The restaurant package defines a Customer interface, which is implemented in the
client package by the class MrBig, a client with a huge appetite. The client
is also able to eat multiple rounds.

The restaurant simulation can be run with a script in the projects root.
To start the script, open a terminal or command line in the working directory of the project

[source,sh]
----
./run.sh client.Main
----

Starting the script with no parameters will show the default (old) situation
and is used as a reference. In that case 44 meals will be served with a total value (turn over) of € 468.00.

.Running the program should show a lot of text, ending with
[source,text]
----
You asked "Are you sattisfied?" table 1 Client says: No I missed some:
orders  44 => 4, served missing
served 404 => 4, orders missing
######################## Restaurant Mei Ling is closed #########################
total cookingTime = 616 milliseconds on 44 meals.
restaurant Mei Ling was open for 766 miliseconds
Turnover this round: €        468.00
expected turnover  : €        468.00
served 1 round to 1 customer , which should add up to 44 meals served

real	0m1,036s
user	0m0,921s
sys	0m0,085s
----

The important numbers, and part of the functional requirement are

* the number of meals cooked and served (44 in the example),
* the total cooking time, because the meals should be 'well done', and
* the turnover which for 1 round and customer is € 460.00.

The _non_ functional numbers are the opening time (766 milliseconds) and the total running time of the program, real, user and sys.
These are the numbers that might improve when applying the proper measure of parallel work. However, take proper care of the concurrent
aspects otherwise you leave the kitchen in shambles. +
The times at the end may differ and depend on the speed of you system.

The program (`client.Main`) reads its arguments array and interprets the first value as the number of rounds
for the one customer. The meals and turnover should simply be multiplied by that number to be correct.

There is a variant of the Main program called `client.MainWithThreads`, which understands
more positional parameters.

. The number of rounds that mrBig will order (and consume).
. The number of mrBig instances that are allowed in the restaurant in this run.
. 's' or 'p' a character that defines if the customers are served on after the other (s = sequentially)
 or in parallel (p). s is the default, if you do not specify it.

.Example run with sequential serving.
[source,sh]
----
./run.sh client.MainWithThreads 2 4 s
----

This will work for all sequential cases, where the number of meals and the turn over will be multiple
of rounds times customers times the baseline meal count of turn over.


.example run with parallel serving
[source,sh]
----
./run.sh client.MainWithThreads 2 4 p
----

When you choose the parallel option (p as last parameter), you will see
that the meals and turnover do not properly add up.

Therein lies part of the problem. The current implementation of the restaurant and helper (i.e. the Queue class)
is not *Tread Safe*. You can see that from the last experiment.  In a parallel run you will see that the outcome is different from
the expectation based on the base line. You will even notice that the outcomes are non-deterministic or by chance,
because they typically differ from run to run. Once in a while you may even be _lucky_, because there is a chance that the numbers add up, proving
the point that running a test once might not be enough to detect problems.

[WARNING]
====
A program that is used in a parallel or concurrent context but is not Thread Safe is a broken program.
====

All work to be done, restaurant application wise, is in the Restaurant and Queue classes.
Doing the work (invoking the methods) is done in the DonaldTask class.

We will approach this task differently from the tasks in the previous weeks, in that
a working and tested program is already given. The intend is that you first explore
the effects of improper concurrent use of resources by either running the program with different parameters
or enable some of the test in the csvsource test in the `ConcurrentClientTest` test class.

As known from the theory and tips and warnings in this exercise, the problem lies in the
concurrent use of several resources of the restaurant.

. Identify the shared resources (i.e. fields) in the restaurant.
. Investigate how you can make their use concurrent or  *Thread Safe*, which is the common term for
  that in the java world. There is one class that is under your control and can be improved in this aspect.
. Modify the shared resources to thread safe types and retest the program. The baseline program should work and give
  the same outcome.
. making the queue class thread safe by making all methods `synchronized`, and retest.

[WARNING]
====
Beware of the check-then-act problem. This problem occurs when there is time gap
between a check, like an empty() check and acting upon that result, like getting the next element with a get(). Another
thread might have taken the last element in that time gap, making the checking thread fail.
====

*Your task*

It is up to you to repair this simulation
  program. Happily there already is a working program, which
  faithfully simulates the work like Donald does it *on his own*. In
  programming terms: Donald is modelled as one Thread.footnote:[Notice that ducks have tiny heads. They do not support
    very much of multithreading. Donald even less so.]. It is your job
  to add more threads, as a simulation for the jobs of the nephews. In the
  cooking part of the program `sleep()` calls are used to
  simulate cooking time. You are not allowed to add more
  sleeps. Of course we expect an optimal program, meaning that you
  should use the resources (CPU, Memory) sparingly, and make sure that the
  results match the baseline with optional multiplication by rounds and customers.

*A customer in shop, help.* +
Of course we have a customer too. In comparison to earlier versions, complaining (exception
throwing) has been turned into serving a *404 meal* immediately. This is similar to the behavior of a web sever,
that will serve a 404 page when it cannot find a requested page.
The customer simulation class will check and tell what has been ordered
and served and will say if this differs. It *will* differ when
the customer orders a non existing meal.

You will be given a maven project of the current implementation, Donald only.

[TIP]
====
Concurrency problems can occur with all shared fields, in particular when such
field is modified by multiple cooperating threads. The queue class is a typical problem area. But there
are more problematic places in this restaurant.
====

There are multiple solutions to solving the thread safety issues in the queue class. The simplest
is to synchronization, which what we used. Using Lock Objects as described in Hortsman Vol I sections 12.4.3
and is more modern, but also a bit more complex. The condition to check is the empty condition.
It is sufficient to use the simpler approach spelled out in section 12.4.5 and/or 12.4.6.


*Testing*

Testing is done with four test classes:ff

. The restaurant.QueueTest that tests the queue.
. The restaurant.RestaurantTest that ensures that the restaurant outputs something to its system out.
. The restaurant.ConcurrentQueueTest that test the queue for thread safety. The
. The client.ConcurrentClientTest which is a kind of _integration_ test, that tests the whole system. The approach is similar to
  what happens in the main classes. +
  MrBig uses a separate library to verify that all orders are served: https://javabits.fontysvenlo.org/tallymap/apidocs/index.html[tallymap].


In this exercise the only thing that you need to do with the given tests in the test classes is enable them
when you are solving the problem. Testing concurrent code is an art in itself and beyond the scope of PRC2.

//
//
// the QueueTest tests the Queue. In the ConcurrentClientTest
// test several scenarios, one to set the baseline (which of course is expected to stay working)
// and one to test several combinations of customers in parallel and a number of rounds.
//
// *Restaurant V1* +
// In restaurant V1 you apply will thread safety constructs.footnote:[as introduced in class] using the
// synchronization primitives provide by the Java platform. You may (or
// should) add threads, but leave the work definition (the method that
// order, serve and cook) in the restaurant class. Add synchronization where needed.
//
// *Rules for V1* +
// You should not (as in forbidden) move any of the methods for cooking
// or serving from the restaurant class into another class. The work
// definition is part of the application (the restaurant) so leave it
// there. You ARE allowed to break the methods or loops apart, (e.g. move
// to new method) so you may solve the concurrent access and
// synchronization puzzle. Note that the queues are not the only things
// that are not thread safe. In the first version, leave the queue
// alone. Synchronize in the restaurant on any object that will do the
// trick.
//
// You should start with some analysis of your initial restaurant. Then
// start designing the improvements.
//
// * Select and elaborate your policy for making the Restaurant thread safe, that
//   is, the policy that you used to move Version 0.1 to your version
//   1.0, thread safe, using three employees. Well, ducks, if you insist on sticking to the narative.
// * Analyze all possible situations where things could go wrong and come
//   up with your  solutions and implement them.
// * Test your code against the chosen policy. Don't alter your code
//   in your Restaurant 1.0, except for possible testing code lines. Also
//   look at the CPU-usage.
//
//
// Now improve on the implementation: +
// *TIP*: Make the given queue thread safe and add a \Code{T
//   take()} method that blocks on an empty queue.
//
// You may have to break some methods in the restaurant apart, as in
// introduce new methods. NetBeans IDE knows how to help you there. Some
// methods in V0.1 have some nasty loops which you may want to modify to
// optimally use your Thread Safe Queue without hogging the CPU any
// longer than required.
