*Drinkers A.K.A. Bad Bar Dreams*

The drinkers project template is in your repository.

This is an exercise about enums, exceptions and generics.
It is about drinks, quantities and things being thrown and how to keep
all this generic.

The problem here is not how to serve a drink, but how to convince the compiler
that feeding the proper drink to the right consumer is allowed, without too much of casting.
So for instance when you have a BeerDrinker, that the instance's would accept a beer.


*Implement the enum class BeerQuantity* +
Implement the enum class `BeerQuantity` according its javadoc.

*Implement testGetBeer() and getBeer()*
The bartender (Bart) is a cautious guy: he checks the beer stock every time
before he draws a serving. If the stock does not suffice he throws
an `AlmostOutOfBeerException` in the method `getBeer(...)`.

Write the `testGetBeer()` method in the `BarTenderTest` class. Afterwards,
change the implementation of the `getBeer()` method in the BarTender class
to let the test pass.

*Big Business Bartender*

NOTE: *Challenging exercise:*
Booze is a recurring topic here.

Note that the diagram above is not a real class diagram, but
something the BarTender understands.

The BigBusinessBartender is a special Bartender that serves several types
of drinks and serves guests (a list of Drinkers) by the busloads. The
`BigBusinessBartenderTest` class is given, as well as the
`serveByTheBusLoad(...)` method implementation in class BigBusinessBartender.

Implement the consumer methods below:

* Implement `serveBeer( drinker )`

* Implement `serveLemonade( drinker )`

* Implement `serveWhisky( drinker )`
