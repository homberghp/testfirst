== FX Triangulation

The widget you will create is to do https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_triangulation[Polygon triangulation].
It is an activity done by surveyor teams.

In the first part we will create a custom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_widget[widget]
with its own controller and https://openjfx.io/javadoc/16/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/Node.html[Java FX Node],
in this particular case a https://openjfx.io/javadoc/16/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/Group.html[Group]

You will complete a GUI component or Widget that will be used in the SurveyorApp in the second part.

The advantages of developing a widget is a separate project are:

* Potential reuse.
* Separation of concerns.
* Example of work separation. That what has been unit tested and coverage tested\
  can be put as a separate task for a developer.
* Didactic: show the use and impact of JPMS

.Conventions in the triangulator.

*Roles of the bindings*

* The corners of the triangle are represented as circles.
* *Length of leg* The leg of a triangle is used to determine the distance between the corners. +
  when they coincide with the legs of a polygon, they measure the length of that leg.
* *Midpoint* of the lines are used in the GUI to position the attached length- and
  name labels of the triangle edges.
* *Center point or center of gravity of the triangle*. Used to place the area label of the triangle.
* *Active lines* To be able to measure the sum of lengths of the edges, some, but not all edges of the triangle are relevant.

=== Use of the Triangulator in the Surveyor App.

.Surveyor App UI
image::surveyor-in-use.png[]

The Triangulator is a component that is used in the Surveyor App.
You will find the app in your repository too, as an example to play with, but has no tests nor
required business code for you to complete. See is as a code example of JPMS modular use and how a self created widget
can be integrated in another project.

The requirements are more or less given by the (picture) of the UI and:

* The user must be able to manipulate both the points of the triangle by dragging them with a mouse,
and set the individual coordinates of the points in text fields.
* The UI should show the area measured by the triangulator in a separate label.
* Same for the lengths of the lines.
* Since not all lines participate in the measurement of the border of a polygon, it should be able
  to specify which lines participate in the border length for a certain measurement.
* It should be able to summarize as in sum up the results of the measurements, so as to determine both the *total border length* and the *total area* of a _polygon_.
* The polygon must be visible and loadable in some way.

You will use JavaFX bindings to show the changing values of side lengths and area
of a triangle. This is a tool that might be of use for surveyors. It uses the
same mathematical computations to compute the enclosed area of a triangle.

A triangle is determined by three points, A, B, C.
The sides are called a,b, and c, where _a_ is opposite point *A* etc.
[red]#A#, [red]#a#, [green]#B#, [green]#b#, [blue]#C#, and [blue]#c#, have the colours [red]#red#, [green]#green#, and [blue]#blue#.

The length of a side is determined by the formula of Pythagoras.
stem:[ l= \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)\times(x2-x1)+(y_2-y_1)\times(y_2-y_1)} ]

Let stem:[A_x,A_y] be the coordinates for point stem:[A], similar for stem:[B] and stem:[C].


The length  stem:[a] of the side opposite stem:[A]:
stem:[ a= \sqrt{(C_x-B_x)\times(C_x-B_x)+(C_y-B_y)\times(C_y-B_y)}].

With this we can also compute side lengths stem:[b] and stem:[c].

With lengths a, b, and c  the area of a triangle can be determined with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula[Heron's formula].

Let stem:[s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}]

Then the area of the triangle is  stem:[\text{Area}= \sqrt{s\times(s-a)\times(s-b)\times(s-c)}].

The link:{exercises}/fxtriangulate/apidocs/index.html[javadoc] of the application
and the link:{exercises}/fxtriangulate/testapidocs/index.html[test javadoc] are available by following the links.

* In the diagram you have three lines, red, green and blue, and three circles, also red, green and blue.
* In all cases the circle is opposite the line of the same color.
* The lines connect the circles of the _other_ colors.

The triangulator supports the concept of *active lines*. An active line participates in the binding to find the total length of the
circumference. When using the triangulator to survey an polygon shaped area, not all legs of the triangle should be used. The only exception
is when the polygon to survey is itself a triangle.
If a triangle leg  coincides with one of the sides of the polygon, it can be used to measure the length of that side,
but only once for each coincidence, to prevent double count.

You can find the test descriptions and the methods to be tested in the source code. +
Look for the todo's with kbd:[CTRL+6] in NetBeans IDE.

If you want to run the triangulator as a separate app,
you may have to include a property in the [blue]#pom.xml# file that states
what the main class is.

.Set the main class in the properties section
[source,xml]
----
   <properties>
   ...
    <exec.mainClass>fxtriangulate.App</exec.mainClass>
   ...
   </properties>
----

To start it from the command line you can use a script that creates a jpms image and runs the jvm from there.

.Linux and Mac script
[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash

if [ ! -f target/fxtriangulate/bin/java ]; then
    mvn -P fx -Dexec.mainClass=fxtriangulate.App javafx:jlink # <1>
fi

## run the java version in the fxtriangulate image.
target/fxtriangulate/bin/java -m fxtriangulate/fxtriangulate.App # <2>
----

<1> Build an java image.
<2> Run the app from the image directory.

.Windows version (untested)
[source,bat]
----
@echo off
set java=target/fxtriangulate/bin/java
if not exist %java% call mvn -P fx -Dexec.mainClass=fxtriangulate.App javafx:jlink
echo.
target/fxtriangulate/bin/java -m fxtriangulate/fxtriangulate.App
----

[TIP]
====
If one of the givens tests. in particular GUITests.tLength fails on your machine, it may have to do
with the locale of your machine. In week 10 we provide a link:week10.html#_number_formats[solution for that exact problem].
We have put it there because it belongs to the topics of that week.

When running the scripts in the above example, the file [black]*target/fxtriangulate.zip* contains a complete image for the application.
You should be able to deploy it on another machine with the same architecture. Because the image brings along its own java virtual machine and
libraries, you do not have to have java installed on the target machine.
This way of deployment is very similar to what you see in app stores on mobile devices. The app brings along its complete set of
required dependencies and resources. The advantages are easy deployment. The disadvantage is big images, which take up a lot of space.
But that appears to be a minor problem nowadays. And since the image created by jlink contains only the required parts of the JDK and
not all of it, there is a gain in using [blue]*jlink* as a path to deployment.

The trimming down of the image is one of the features made possible by the Java Platform Module System.

.You can run the triangulator from netbeans (green play button at the top) with the following settings:
