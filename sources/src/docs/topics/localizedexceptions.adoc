== Testing Localized Exceptions

The standard way of testing exceptions with assertj is explained in link:week01.html#_assert_exceptions[week01].

To get to the localized message, which contains the message as translated by the locale framework is a bit more involved.

Luckily, AssertJ allows you to extract information from a Throwable, by using an extractor function. Now the Lambda bells should ring.

.To make a long story very short: here is an example:
[source,java]
----
    String[] keys = keyWords.split( "\\|");
    assertThatThrownBy( () -> {
                MainSimulation.main( args );
    } ).isExactlyInstanceOf( exceptionMap.get( expectionClassName ) )
            .extracting( e -> e.getLocalizedMessage() ) // <1>
            .asString()           //<2>
            .contains( keys ); //<3>
----

<1> extract using [blue]`Function<? super Throwable,â€‹T>`, [black]`e -> getLocalizedMessage()` in this case.
<2> Get the assertion for in String. Do [red]*not* use `toString()`, because that produces a _String_, not an [blue]*AbstractStringAssert*.
<3> And use the assert to check that the string contains the required key information.

.If you turn on type hints in NetBeans-IDE (or in intelij) you can see what the type is on which you call `contains(keys)`
