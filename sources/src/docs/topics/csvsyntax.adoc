== CSV Syntax


CSV is one a the very simply file formats that is easily understood. We will use it to
explain **E**xtended **B**ackus-**N**aur **F**orm, and as bridge to the fact that lexers and parsers can in fact be implemented using state machines.

Th easiest to read representation is a so call https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram[Railroad Diagram].
There is a lot of detail in the drawing style.

The rules are simple: you are only allowed to drive forward in a straight line or in a curved line,
but no across an acute angle, because that will run the train off the track, causing a train wreck.

In the diagram the train starts at the left and can either go straight through the quoted track or turn right to the unquoted
track. Turning left is not allowed, because that would run the train off the track.

The diagrams are helpful for us humans to understand. Note how close these railroad diagrams are to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram[state diagram]s,
and indeed there is a close relation.

A computer will have a hard time to grasp the meaning of the diagram, but breaks no sweat when it needs
to create the diagram from a notation it can comprehend. One such notation is the Backus-Naur Form or
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form[EBNF ^]. +
Backus-Naur is named after John Backus and Peter Naur.

The diagram above has been generated from the following definition, by the nice website https://bottlecaps.de/rr/ui[Railroad Diagram Generator].
Thank you, Gunther Rademacher.

.EBNF of CSV row
[source,sh]
----
row       ::= (quoted|unquoted) (',' (quoted|unquoted))* '\n'
quoted    ::= '"' (Char|'\"'|'\\')* '"'
unquoted  ::= (Char|'\"'|'\\')*

In an earlier exercise we create a small library called CSVObjectStream. That has an unmentioned flaw, is that
it does not really understand what it is doing. It only knows how to chop up lines with separators. This in itself
relies on another application of state machines, Regular Expressions.
However, the CSV format allows columns to contain commas, put if they are processed by the naive approach in CSVObjectStream,
than what should be in one column, will land int two. So we need something more sophisticated.

We need a csv-row lexer, that can separate the column values out from the csv rows, considering quotes as a way to
project embedded commas from being column-breaks.

We need a small state machine that takes the separate characters from the rows, which a simply strings, and
collects those characters into tokens, with a specific meaning. There are x states, between which the state machine will switch,
and which can tell their context that a token is complete and what its 'class' is. In the CSV example the class does not have much meaning,
it is just a value, but in advanced versions, we will not make here, it could be numbers, or text values or dates, etc.
