== Testing exceptions

Exceptions can occur anywhere but most of the time when calling a method.
When testing code that throws or should throw exceptions, we can distinguish three cases,
each with a different approach. Assume in all cases that the method is defined with a throws clause,
as in `void read( int mount ) throws IOException`.

. The exception should not be thrown.
. The exceptions should be thrown.
. The exception is thrown, but unexpectedly.

To test these cases we use two distinct approaches, covering the first two cases. The last case
is automatically dealt with by the JUnit test framework, because any exception
that occurs is considered a failure. If unexpected by the test then it is typically the test's problem.

=== Exception is not expected: forward it.

Simply forward the exception. Remember that a (test) method signature is only name and parameter types, not throws clause. So if you do not
expect the checked exception to occur in a test method, DO NOT deal with it, but forward it.

.Forward exception by having a throws clause
[source,java]
----
@Test
void testRead() throws IOException {
  String s = this.reader.read();
  assertThat(s).isEqualTo(...);
}
----

=== Exception is expected to be thrown

The test method sets up the tests so that the exception should occur. You want to make sure that the
exact proper method call does the throwing, not any expression before or after the 'culprit'.
In that case you wrap the expression as a lambda expression of
type https://javadoc.io/doc/org.assertj/assertj-core/latest/org/assertj/core/api/ThrowableAssert.ThrowingCallable.html[ThrowingCallable].

.Method definition of throwing callable.
[source,java]
----
  void call() throws Throwable;
----

.Lambda expersion with shape of ThrowingCallable
[source,java]
----
   () -> {ExceptionThrowingCode}
----

.The trivial but instructive example from the AssertJ assertion framework.
[source,java]
----
   assertThatThrownBy(() -> { throw new IOException("boom!") }, "Test explosive code") // <1>
           .isInstanceOf(IOException.class) // <2>
           .hasMessageContaining("boom"); // <3>
----

<1> This is of course not a real test, because the code in the lambda throws the exception by itself. +
 Instead imagine that a method is called or some other expression is evaluated that throws the expected exception
<2> Assert that the proper exception is caught and thus thrown.
<3> Assert that the message has the correct info. For further details see https://javadoc.io/static/org.assertj/assertj-core/3.15.0/org/assertj/core/api/Assertions.html#assertThatThrownBy(org.assertj.core.api.ThrowableAssert.ThrowingCallable,java.lang.String,java.lang.Object...)[assertThatThrownBy API doc ]

=== Exception occurs unexpectedly

Well, if you did not expect the exception, the only way to go about is to revise your test code, because
there may be something wrong in the test setup. You might need another test to assert that an exception is not thrown.
There is a construct for exactly that too.

.Make sure the ThrowingCallable is NOT the culprit
[source,java]
----
   ThrowingCallable doNothing = () -> {}; // <1>
   assertThatCode(doNothing).doesNotThrowAnyException();
----
<1> replace lambda by actual suspect code.
