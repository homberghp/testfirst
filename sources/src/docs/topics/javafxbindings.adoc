== Java FX Bindings

The graphic style of JavaFX is already quite nice. The architecture
of JavaFX applied the lessons learned from the earlier Java framework AWT and Swing.

[TIP]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)[Swing] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Window_Toolkit[AWT] are the Java GUI
frameworks with which NetBeans IDE and Intelij is built.
That proves that these framworks are still in use in the industry. +
There is another Java GUI framework word mentioning, which is https://www.eclipse.org/swt/[SWT], developed by IBM under the Eclipse flag.
You may be familiar with the style if you have used for instance https://dbeaver.io/[DBeaver].

One of the other important innovations are the JavaFX bindings.
They provide an elegant way to distribute dynamic information throughout a
GUI application, and help separating business and GUI code.

The concept of bindings relies on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern[Observer Pattern],
which says that a change producing instance can inform an interested party about a change that happenend.

The classic observer pattern informs all of its *Observers*, or *Listeners* immediately of and change.
The JavaFX approach is to relax a bit and take the Lazy approach.
Being lazy is good, because avoiding work that is (not yet) needed is a way to reduce work and
in the end speed up an application.

The idea is to only invalidate a value when a change happens, and only start the computation when some one
actually needs the result, for instance the GUI layer that needs to do a redraw. +
Since Observables can be chained, changing one value may trigger a whole avalanche of computations.
In JavaFx, it is still an avalanche, but of [green]*invalidations*, and [green]_no_ computations. The computation is only done
when some one needs the result.

JavaFX defines so called Properties in the `javafx.beans` package and its sub-packages `javafx.beans.properties` and `javafx.beans.bindings`.

The https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/binding/jfxpub-binding.htm[Oracle tutorial] by Scott Hommel sheds some light on the matter.

The Bindings and Properties packages provide several ways to create bindings, including expressions of various types,
with specialized properties for [blue]#int#, [blue]#long#, and [blue]#double# as the most important
specializations.

// simple Examples
// Fluent Api
=== Binding APIs

.In all examples we use two IntegerProperties.
[source,java]
----
    IntegerProperty num1 = new SimpleIntegerProperty( 1 );
    IntegerProperty num2 = new SimpleIntegerProperty( 2 );
----

.Bindings using Fluent API, from Oracle Tutorial
[source,java]
----
    NumberBinding sum = num1.add( num2 ); // <1>
    System.out.println( sum.getValue() );
    num1.set(2);                          // <2>
    int result= sum.getValue();           // <3>
    System.out.println( result );
----

<1> Creates the binding but does NOT compute anything
<2> Set the value, and invalidates the value, so observers must recalculate.
<3> The get is the observer's action that actually triggers the actual computation.


.Bindings class
[source,java]
----
    NumberBinding sum = Bindings.add(num1,num2); //<1>
    System.out.println(sum.getValue());
    num1.setValue(2);                            // <2>
    int result= sum.getValue();                  // <3>
    System.err.println( result );
----

<1> Creates the binding but does NOT compute anything
<2> Set the value, and invalidates the value, so observers must recalculate.
<3> The get is the observer's action that actually triggers the actual computation.

.Low level API
[source,java]
----
    IntegerBinding sum( IntegerProperty n1, IntegerProperty n2 ) {
        return new IntegerBinding() {      // <1>

            {                              // <2>
                super.bind( n1, n2 );
            }

            @Override
            protected int computeValue() { // <3>
                return n1.get()+n2.get();
            }
        };
    }
----

<1> Anonymous inner class with `IntegerBinding` as [blue]#super# class.
<2> Anonymous 'constructor' that tells the binding what its dependencies are.
<3> The computation, which can be arbitrarily complex, and is only executed if
some one ask the super for get(), which will then invoke `computeValue()`. Note the use of protected, so
this method is only callable from within the hierarchy between the IntegerBinding and its anonymous sub class.
computeValue is the only abstract method in [blue]#abstract class# *IntegerBinding*.

// asString() vs toString()

[WARNING]
Quite often, and certainly when dealing with a GUI, you need to translate the values of a binding into
its String representation. In this case [red]#toString()# does [big red]*NOT* cut it. +
What you need is a https://openjfx.cn/javadoc/16/javafx.base/javafx/beans/binding/StringBinding.html[StringBinding] that is created
from the Binding you want to show as text. That is what [blue]#public StringBinding asString()# in the Binding framework is for.


=== Unbinding DoubleBinding dependencies

There are use cases where you have to unbind bindings. One such use case is the exercise FXTriangulate.
The DoubleBinding abstract class implements [blue]#javafx.beans.binding.Binding#, which states in its doc that the `getDepencies()` method should not be used
in production code. We therefor will us a simpler approach.

Since the [blue]`protected# bind(...)` and [blue]`protected unbind()` methods both take a _varargs_ argument, which is an array in disguise,
the only thing you can do is to remember all bound bindings and
when you have to unbind one, unbind all and then rebind the remaining.
This appears the most reliable method.

The binding and unbinding is necessary to make the binding listen to its dependencies.

.The code for that looks like this.
[source,java]
----
class ModifyableDoubleBinding extends DoubleBinding {

    Set<ObservableDoubleValue> values = new HashSet<>();

    @Override
    protected double computeValue() {
        double result = values.stream()
                .mapToDouble( ObservableDoubleValue::get ).sum();
        return result;
    }

    void add( ObservableDoubleValue v ) {
        unbind( values.toArray( ObservableDoubleValue[]::new ) ); //<1>
        values.add( v );
        bind( values.toArray( ObservableDoubleValue[]::new ) );
        invalidate();
    }

    void remove( ObservableDoubleValue v ) {
        unbind( values.toArray( ObservableDoubleValue[]::new ) );
        values.remove( v );
        bind( values.toArray( ObservableDoubleValue[]::new ) );
        invalidate();
    }
}
----

<1> `Collection.toArray(IntFunction<T[]> generator)` is a method introduced in Java 11.

=== Caching bindings

Creating bindings is powerful but can still lead to a performance bottleneck. If you create bindings willy-nilly, it might very well
be that the same computation is done at several places and in a GUI screen redraw at almost the same time (or at least the reason) too.

To mitigate that problem, it can be wise to cache a binding once it's created, and serve out the same binding on each subsequent call.
A binding can have many *Listeners*, and it will dutifully inform all of them with either an invalidation call or change event.
The Bindings themselves cache the value of the (last) computation and serve that out until it is 'discarded' on an invalidate call.

[TIP]
The secret sauce in many speed optimizations is avoiding work. Thereby you avoid burning CPU cycles.
And burning them is useless when nobody really needs the result (yet). Being lazy is good, but
it needs some extra work from the programmer.


.Naive approach using computeIfAbsent.
[source,java]
----
    DoubleBinding lengthBinding( Line aLine ) { // <1>
        return lengthBindings
            .computeIfAbsent( aLine,
                l -> lengthBinding(
                      l.startXProperty(),
                      l.startYProperty(),
                      l.endXProperty(),
                      l.endYProperty()
                )
            );
    }
----

<1> We use the line object as key in the map

A naive approach to caching is to inspect a value for [blue]#null# and then instantiate one value when it is.
In this case, because both the creation of the cache entries and the retrieval of the vale take place on the event thread, this naive approach works.

If you want that thread safe, you could use the same map as above with a _surrogate_ key, like a simple object named `Object AREA_KEY = new Object();`.
You then can rely on the thread-safety properties of
 a https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentMap.html[ConcurrentMap]
 instead of using a 'normal' hash map.

.Caching a single value.
[source,java]
----
   /**
    * Cache for area binding.
    */
   private DoubleBinding areaBinding = null;

   /**
    * Create a binding to compute the area with a triangle determined by side
    * lengths a, b and c. This method consults the cache and has the value computed
    *
    * @return the area binding
    */
   final DoubleBinding areaBinding() {
       if ( areaBinding == null ) {
           areaBinding = areaBinding( distanceBinding( redCircle, greenCircle ), //<1>
                   distanceBinding( greenCircle, blueCircle ),
                   distanceBinding( blueCircle, redCircle ) );
       }
       return areaBinding;
   }
   // method that creates the binding is left as an exercise
----

<1> Compute the binding if not yet available.


[WARNING]
The approach of inspecting a value for null and then instantiating a new object when null is NOT threadsafe.
The approach works in this case, because it all happens on the event thread, on the same thread, so there will
be no interfering threads.
