== Using SceneBuilder


When using https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/#download[SceneBuilder] the idea is that you design the scene using SceneBuilder, which effectively
is a what you see is what you get FXML editor. The JavaFx, more specifically the FXML part
builds the graphical components or even the complete UI from such FXML files.

You can have multiple FXML files per application, much like you can have many scenes in a move or stage play.


There are various demos on Scenebuilder on youtube.

.Creating or updating the java controller from the FXML file.

One of the most valuable tips from one of those videos is the fact that you can start with
scenebuilder and define your graphical components and methods in SceneBuilder and hence in the
fxml file and that then NetBeans IDE can _generate_ or *update* the controller for you.
Working in this way can help you avoid typing or (different) spelling errors.

=== Defining Widgets using FXML

You can use FXML to define whole scenes for your application, but also to make your own *specialized components*.
You can then layout them as you want and *import* them into SceneBuilder, where they behave like any other widget already available.
This allows you to extend the available choices, and make special widgets that can play nicely with something like a game or a planning application.

When you want to define your own component, you have to make a few changes to the FXML file and have the component class
load the FXML by itself.

.Typical FXML file for an application.
[source,xml]
----
<AnchorPane id="AnchorPane" fx:id="root" prefHeight="564.0" prefWidth="535.0" stylesheets="@stylesheet.css"
  >
</AnchorPane>
----

.With your own component, you have to define a `fx:root`. Example from FXTriangulator exercise.
[source,xml]
----
<fx:root type="javafx.scene.Group" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/16" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1">
    <Circle fx:id="redCircle" centerX="10.0" centerY="10.0" fill="RED" radius="5.0" />
    <Circle fx:id="greenCircle" centerX="400.0" centerY="10.0" fill="GREEN" radius="5.0" />
    <Circle fx:id="blueCircle" centerX="10.0" centerY="400.0" fill="BLUE" radius="5.0" />
    <Circle fx:id="centerCircle" fill="GREY" radius="5.0" />
   <Line id="redLine" fx:id="redLine" endX="10.0" endY="400.0" startX="400.5" startY="9.5" stroke="RED" />
   <Line id="greenLine" fx:id="greenLine" endX="10.0" endY="400.0" startX="10.0" startY="10.0" stroke="GREEN" />
   <Line id="blueLine" fx:id="blueLine" endX="10.0" endY="10.0" startX="400.0" startY="10.0" stroke="BLUE" />
   <Label fx:id="redLabel" text="a" />
   <Label fx:id="greenLabel" text="b" />
   <Label fx:id="blueLabel" text="c" />
   <Label fx:id="areaLabel" text="" />
</fx:root>
----

From the FXML file you can infer that the widget (in this case) is a specialized https://openjfx.cn/javadoc/16/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/Group.html[java.fx.Group].
It can be any type that is a subclass of https://openjfx.cn/javadoc/16/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/Parent.html[Parent] (including Parent),
if you want the widget to have sub-components.

Then in the Java file that is both controller and the subclass of the component you want to specialize, Group in the example.

.Class header of specialized widget.
[source,java]
----
public class Triangulator extends Group implements Initializable {

    @FXML
    Circle redCircle;
    @FXML
    Circle blueCircle;
    @FXML
    Circle greenCircle;


// stuff left out
    Triangulator( BindingBusiness bb ) {
        this.bb = bb;
        FXMLLoader fxmlLoader =
           new FXMLLoader( getClass().getResource( "triangulator.fxml" ) ); //<1>

        connectLoader( fxmlLoader ); //<2>

        try {
            fxmlLoader.load();
        } catch ( IOException exception ) {
            throw new RuntimeException( exception );
        }
    }

    final void connectLoader( FXMLLoader fxmlLoader ) { // <3>
        fxmlLoader.setRoot( this );
        fxmlLoader.setController( this );
    }

// more stuff left out
}

<1> Load the widgets fxml definitions. This will insert all @FXML  annotated  fields
and would attach the actions to the @FXML annotated methods.
<2> Connect [blue]*this* to the loaded FXML document.
<3> Use a final or private method to set the root and controller of the loaded object to this, to
   avoid the warning of exposing this in the constructor.

In the example widget we have three dots connected with lines. The dots are draggable, while the lines stay connected.
The lengths can be computed using Bindings and are thus automatically updated, and are shown next to the lines.

We will use such a widget in the next example.

.Library settings hidden behind a cog-wheel.

Importing into scenebuilder is then done using the tiny cog next to the search text-field labeled Library. When you choose *Jar/FXML Manager*, you can add
widget libraries like you would with maven or point at a library on you machine.
