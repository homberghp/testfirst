== Test quality

So testing is to improve code quality. But is there any quality measure to tests?

Sure there is:

* Work test driven, duh. In the standard TDD cycle, you should have your test
  to be red first. That's one.
* You can *break* your code and see if the tests make you aware of it. They should show
  a nice deep red (at least some of them). If they do not, you are working according to the TDD cycle. That's two.
* You can measure the coverage of your tests. Sebipom provides a tool for that called https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/[JaCoCo]
that you can turn on in your IDE or when running form the command line.
It shows how much of the _business_ code is executed by your tests. That's three.
* For the lazy ones (aren't we all) and easily repeatable too: Have you code automatically mutated
  by some tool. Your tests should find most if not all issues after mutating. The tool provided for this
  is https://pitest.org/[pit-test]footnote:[A British synonym for mine is pit, that is why you have the bird with the helmet as logo]

Let's go through the method one by one.

=== TDD

These you know:

* There is no test before there is a requirement.
* And there is no business code before a test.

So if a method is not specified, then do not write a test for it, and do not write the method either.

The only reason to have a method is because the specs demand it. And they should state

* what the method is supposed to do
* in which states of the object the method call is legal
* any requirement of the parameters to the method
* specification of result, possibly in a set of input-output tests cases.
* any exceptions that can be thrown and under what conditions
* the state that the object is left after completion of (or return from) the method.

If the user stories are complemented with proper scenarios (which they should to help you write your test),
then you can write the tests easily, feature for feature and thereby test-driven develop the business code.

Writing your test first, which makes the business break first. +
 Always give the IDE a chance to code-complete whatever you try to
  invoke in your test, because the business code does not yet exist, so that the test is meaningful.
  A IDE generated `throw new UnsupportedOpretaionException( "this method needs implementation" )` is not very useful,
  but returning something of the proper type (for non-void methods) is a better choice.
  If you think it is a sly trick to return the correct value
  the first time, then you are in bad luck because:

. You will have a test that has not been red.
. You will have to invent other test cases, to complement the 'correct' one.

So best start with return `0`, `false` or `null`. If your test is already green in that case, choose another
'impossible' value such as `42`, `true` or a simplest version of the expected result type , such as `"wrong"` for Strings.

=== Break your code

If you do not, we will force you. We will regularly, but only after a commit, ask you to break some of the business code
to see that the tests notice. We will also do something similar in the correction of the performance assessment, that is
we will feed your test broken business code and the test code should notice that.

As promised, breaking your code by a program is easy. It is built in by the magic of pit-test.

.Command line First
[source,sh]
----
mvn test org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
----

.Pit mutationCoverage is about in the middle.

You can also use NetBeans ID.
Click on the project. Then the navigator should show the possible maven goals. +
Choose pittest mutationCoverage. This will produce an index.html report
in target/pit-reports which contains date-time-stamped folders cont. Choose the latest if you have more of those folders. +
You can also have NetBeans IDE remember this by going *run maven -> Goals ->*, then in the dialog
add `test org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage` and save it as e.g. *pit*.

This last results in an addition to the *nbaction.xml* file like this:

.Pit saved in nbaction.xml
[source,xml]
----
    <action>
        <actionName>CUSTOM-pit</actionName>
        <displayName>pit</displayName>
        <goals>
            <goal>test</goal>
            <goal>org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage</goal>
        </goals>
    </action>
