== JPMS and Method handles

Reflection and MethodHandles belong to the advanced magic.

MethodHandles were introduced in Java 7. They work fine inside a java release <= 8 project.

Java **Modules** where introduced in Java 9. The concept is known as the Java Platform Module System or JPMS.
JPMS is a watershed between somewhat encapsulated and really encapsulated code. The java Guys and Girls mean business.

One of the design goals of JPMS is to provide and maintain developer flexibility and
protection against unwanted access. Since Java 9, the control and defaults have been turned up with almost every release.
Java 9 had all the mechanism in place but is quite permissive by default.
Java 16 denies a lot more, and flipped from opt-in to opt-out as far as (reflective) openness is concerned.

*We will give more details on JPMS in a later week*

For our Mapper approach that means a modular project
introduces some new [red]*bleeding* edge problems. (Actually headache :-| )
In particular, the entities are not reachable for reflection or rather the method
handles that try to access the code in entities from the mapper module.
And having the mapper open or require the entities is a no go, because:

* The mapper is a reusable component. It should be ignorant of its users.
* It would introduce a   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dependency[[red big]*cycle*], because we want to put the leaf-mappers with the entities in the same module,
and the leaf-mapper all point to their [blue]*super*, *Mapper* in the generic mapper module.

Code wise the solution below appears to work in Java 11 and 16, at least as far as I have tried.
This is what the MapperGenerator should 'code'.

.In the constructor you pass a MethodHandles.Lookup up to the mapper.
[source, java]
----
// No public ctor
private EmployeeMapper() {
    super( Employee.class, java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.publicLookup() ); //<1>
}

// self register
static {
    Mapper.register( new EmployeeMapper() );
}
// remainder left out. Code template is in genericmapper project 2.2
----

<1> Pass a [green]*token* to allow access by my super with the same rules as I (EmployeeMapper) can do.

.Watch out for snipers.
image:two-rabbits-in-crosshair.png[role="thumb right", width="300px"]The Employee mapper lives in the entities world, and has been dropped there to
 'operate' on the classes in the modules "below", but needs privileges in the land it is tele-ported in. +

* With this "access token", the JPMS will allow it. +
* You see that the code in the module [green]*itself* can now allow access, instead of being a willing victim
  to any kind of reflector that may point it's cross+hair at you.

As a metaphor: The mapper is a veterinary, that knows all about about rabbits and has healing powers but can also be deadly. +
The patient should trust his doctor, but only so far.

.The module diagram (syntax elements from deployment, class and package diagrams)
image::mapperandmodules.svg[]


You see that the module diagram is free of cycles.
All point at the annotations, the entities module [blue]#requires# the `genericmapper` module
and the client module can use the entities and genericmapper to do its business, like use or extend the mapper.
Add another module (a generic DAO) will be part of the exercise of this week.

.Quiz: Can you draw the DAO in the module diagram including its associations?

====
Add the JPMS DAO somewhere in the diagram and have it require the mapper and the entities, and have the
client require the DAO.
