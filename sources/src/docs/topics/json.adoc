=== JSON materials

The JSON part can be picked up using the <<id:videos,youtube videos>> linked below.

The most common thing you do with Data is transport it.
The modern approach is to use a programming language agnostic format: JSON, which stand for JavaScript Object Notation.

Although the name suggests it is JavaScript only, the format is so simple to encode and relatively simple to decode that it is currently the most use format, in particular for web services.

In this week's topic you will once again see that encoding is typically simpler than decoding. The same as shouting is simpler than listening.

Encoding an object can be as simple as turning the object into a String that conforms JSonÂ´s format and syntax, so no library would be required.
However, if you have the opportunity to write

.simply use the gson library
[source,java]
----
  gson.toJson(student);
----

without even knowing the internal structure of the Student-object, or
instead have to write:

.hand coded json string formatter for student.
[source,java]
----
 static String toJson(Student student){
        return "{\"snummer\":"+student.getSnummer()
                +",\"firstname\":\""+student.getFirstName()
                +"\",\"lastName\":\""+student.getLastName()
                +"\",\"born\":{"
                + "\"year\":"+student.getBorn().getYear()
                + ",\"month\":"+student.getBorn().getMonthValue()
                + ",\"day\":"+student.getBorn().getDayOfMonth()
                +"\"},"
                + "\"gender\":\""+student.getGender()+"\"}";
    }

----

your choice to opt for a library is easily made, if not for anything else as to avoid testing and debugging your way through to a properly format json string.

== Useful links on json testing.

Test Driven means start with the tests.

A *brittle* test is a test that is too specific, in this case a test that fails with the slightest difference between expected and actual, although actual still matches its requirement.
In the case of a JSON document: Using `String.equals(Object jstring)` is the worst imaginable test of this kind, because:

* White space outside the quotes is irrelevant.
* The order of the key-value pairs is NOT significant.
* The types of quotes, whether single ''' or double '"' does not matter, as long as they match.
* Interpretation of escape characters influences the result.

Here is where a special assertion library has its role.

The jsonassert library can be used by any json generating frame work or library

=== GSon, Google's JSON processing library.

You can imagine that google moves a lot of data around. As one of the by-products of their software development, GSon has been created.

The guys at https://futurestud.io/[Future Studio] created a nice and short 5 part tutorial on GSon, and placed it on youtube. Thx Future Studio.
