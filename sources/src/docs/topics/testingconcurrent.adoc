== Testing concurrent programs.

[{extra}]
NOTE: *EXTRA Testing stuff*
Testing is way to show that a program has flaws, not to show that it is correct.
Remember that a proper test must be red, not green to show its worth. +
This is even worse under concurrent conditions and testing concurrent programs is
therefor quite hard. Multiple runs with multiple outcomes may be needed, you (test) program may freeze
up etc.


*There are a few guidelines we want to share.*

* Start testing your algorithm or whatever you have with a single thread, as is the
normal case in unit testing
* Of course you must apply multiple threads when you want to test concurrent behavior.
* Organize the test as a kind of race. All threads should start at the same time
  to maximize parallel work and thereby potential concurrency problems.
* Wait for the race to finish and then check the results, by inspecting the resource,
  assessing that the numbers are Okay, you have no unexpected exceptions such as null pointer.
* Configure some reasonable timeout on the test, so that in case the test does not finish, because the
  threads are somehow locked or waiting for a condition that will not occur.
* Try to modify the program as little as possible, so any instrumentation like starting and stopping
  the tasks should be done by wrapping the normal tasks (e.g. Runnables) in another layer of
  runnables that facilitate starting and stopping of the tasks in a race like fashion.
  Adding say print statements will change the timing of your program and may either introduce effects
  of the concurrency problems in your code or conceal them. Such bugs are called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug[Heisenbugs] after
  the effect described by Werner Heisenberg.

.concurrent queue test

/**
 * Enable the test below once you are about to make your queue thread safe.

@Timeout( value = 2, unit = SECONDS )
@Test
void concurrentTest() throws InterruptedException {

    final CountDownLatch startSignal = new CountDownLatch( 1 );  // <1>
    final CountDownLatch doneSignal = new CountDownLatch( putter.length + getter.length ); // <2>

    setupRace( startSignal, doneSignal );                // <3>

    startSignal.countDown();                             // <4>
    doneSignal.await();                                  // <5>

    final int succesfulPuts = countPutSucces();
    final int succesfulGets = countGetSuccess();

    SoftAssertions.assertSoftly( softly -> {
        softly.assertThat( succesfulPuts ).isEqualTo( PUTTERS * PUTS_PER_THREADS );
        softly.assertThat( succesfulGets ).isEqualTo( GETTERS * PUTS_PER_THREADS );
    } );

<1> Have a start line and
<2> Finish line
<3> Configure the race, details follow
<4> image:startsignal-tiny.png[role="thumb left"]Bang ! Start.
<5> üèÅ wait for all to finish and stay *off* the track while doing so.

After the finish it is a normal test with usual asserts. Using mocks during the race may be tricky because there
the mocks are not likely to be thread safe themselves.

.Set up the race
[source,java]

/**
 * Details of setting up the concurrent test objects.
 *
 * @param startSignal to wait for start of match
 * @param doneSignal signaled when all completed.
 */
private void setupRace( final CountDownLatch startSignal, final CountDownLatch doneSignal ) {
    for ( int i = 0; i < getter.length; i++ ) {
        getter[ i ] = new Getter( instance, PUTS_PER_THREADS ); // <1>
    }

    for ( int i = 0; i < putter.length; i++ ) {
        putter[ i ] = new Putter( instance, PUTS_PER_THREADS );  // <2>
    }

    int p = 0;
    for ( Putter putter1 : putter ) { // <3>
        p++;
        new Thread( new TestWorkWrapper( putter1, startSignal, doneSignal ), "putter" + p ).start();
    }

    int g = 0;
    for ( Getter getter1 : getter ) {
        g++;
        new Thread( new TestWorkWrapper( getter1, startSignal, doneSignal ), "getter" + g ).start();
    }
}

<1> The Getter
<2> and Putter classes are the tasks to be done under concurrent conditions.
  They all use the same Queue instance. The race is configured to have 5 putter and getters each,
  both attempting a PUTS_PER_THREADS operations on the queue.
<3> Each are wrapped in a TestWorkWrapper and the start and done signals for this race.
  These wrappers themselves are given as tasks (Runnable) to named threads, who are started immediately.

.Getter as example task to test the quality of the queue under concurrent access by both putters and getters
[source,java]

/**
 * Simple getter class. Tries in a loop until somethings is retrieved and
 * then prints that. Attempts a configured number of times.
 */
static class Getter implements Runnable {

    final Queue<String> q;
    int attempts;
    int successCount = 0;

    Getter( Queue<String> q, int attempts ) {
        this.q = q;
        this.attempts = attempts;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        while ( attempts > 0 ) {

            String x = null;
            // wait until we have something
            while ( x == null ) {
                x = q.get();
            }

            successCount++;
            System.out.println( "x = " + x );
            attempts--;
        }
    }

.Match or race instrumentation to make all runnables to commence at the same time and have them signal when done.

static class TestWorkWrapper implements Runnable {

    final Runnable work;
    final CountDownLatch startSignal;
    final CountDownLatch doneSignal;

    TestWorkWrapper( Runnable work, CountDownLatch startSignal, CountDownLatch doneSignal ) {
        this.work = work;
        this.startSignal = startSignal;
        this.doneSignal = doneSignal;

        } catch ( InterruptedException ex ) {
            Logger.getLogger( ConcurrentQueueTest.class.getName() ).log( Level.SEVERE, null, ex );
        } finally {
            doneSignal.countDown();                  // <3>
            System.out.println( "finished worker " + Thread.currentThread().getName() );

}

<1> Wait for start signal
<2> Run, run.
<3> Signal that the work returned from running by countdown for this wrapped work.


The example given might be useful in other cases, but we will not give a guarantee
that it will work reliably in all or any cases.
