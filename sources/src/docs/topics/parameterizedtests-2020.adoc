== Parameterized tests

image::waste.jpg[role="related thumb right", width=480,title="Do not become a ctrl+c, ctrl+v junky. That only produces junk."]
You will often see that test methods look a lot like each other. As an example:
In the fraction exercise, in most test methods you have two inputs and on or two results,
then an operation is done followed by some assertion, often of the same kind.
This quickly leads to the habit of _copy and waste_ programming. Many errors are introduced this way: You copy the original,
tweak the copy a bit and you are done. Then you forget one required tweak, because they are easy to miss, but you do not notice it until too late.

[WARNING]
====
Avoid _copy and waste_ at almost all times. It is not a good programming style. If you see it in your code, refactor it to
remove the copies and in the end have less of it. Worse: When the original has a flaw, you are just multiplying the
number of flaws in your code. This observation applies to test code just as well. +
*CODE THAT IS NOT THERE CAN'T BE WRONG*.

=== Parameterized test, Junit 5 style

Below you see an example on how you can condense the `toString()` tests of fraction from 5 very similar test methods into 5 strings containing the test data
and 1 (say one) test method.

.Complete fraction test class with parameterized test, using an in-code csv source
[source,java]
----
package fraction;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.aggregator.ArgumentsAccessor;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.CsvSource;

public class FractionCSVSourceTest {

    @ParameterizedTest
  @CsvSource(
             {
               //"message,      expected,     n,   d", //<1>
               "two thirds,      '(2/3)',     2,   3", //<2>
               "whole number,    '2',         2,   1",
               "one third,       '(1/3)',    -3,  -9",
               "minus two fifths, '(-2/5)',  12, -30",
               "-one + two fifths, '-1(2/5)', 35, -25"
            } )
    void fractionOps( ArgumentsAccessor args ) {
        String message = args.getString( 0 ); // <3>
        String expected = args.getString( 1 );
        int n = args.getInteger( 2 ); //<4>
        int d = args.getInteger( 3 );
        Fraction f = new Fraction( n, d );
        assertThat( f.toString() )
                .as( message )
                .isEqualTo( expected );
    }
}

<1> Adding a comment is always a good idea. You may also want your values aligned for improved readability.
<2> Parameters are separated by commas, which maybe in the test values. You can demarcate Strings with single quotes inside the csv record string.
  If you need another separator instead of comma, you can specify that too,
  see https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.params/org/junit/jupiter/params/provider/CsvSource.html[CsvSource API ^].
<3> Getting the parameters from the csv records or lines is a bit reminiscent to using a `Scanner` object.
<4> Same here, pick up integer values. Same goes for other numeric types.


For more details see https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests[Junit 5 parameterized tests ^].

=== Lookup lambda in a map.

Lambdas are special. The have no name and not a very useful toString, which you cannot even overwrite.
But you can do the reverse: translate a string into a lambda, by using a map. You can then use simple names (strings),
that can be put in a csv record. You could, if you wanted, even use the lambda expression i String form as a key.

[source,java]
----
   Map.of("(a,b)->a+b", (a,b)->a+b)
----

Note that this does not really help readability and might be a bit brittle is you are not consistent in your usage of white space.

.Map of string to lambda
[source,java]
----
    final Map<String, BiFunction<Fraction, Fraction, Fraction>> ops = // <1>
      Map.of(
              "times", ( f1, f2 ) -> f1.times( f2 ),
              "plus", ( f1, f2 ) -> f1.plus( f2 ),
              "flip", ( f1, f2 ) -> f1.flip(), // <2>
              "minus", ( f1, f2 ) -> f1.minus( f2 ),
              "divideBy", ( f1, f2 ) -> f1.divideBy( f2 )
      );
----

<1> Not that we use a https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/BiFunction.html[BiFunction<T,U,R>],
with *T*, *U* and *R* all of the same type: Fraction. This is legal.
<2> f2 is not used in the right hand side of the arrow. This is legal too.

.Using lambda names in test data
[source,java]
----
    @CsvSource(
             {
                "'one half times one third is 1 sixth', 'times', '(1/6)',1,2,1,3", // <1>
                "'one thirds plus two thirds is 1'    , 'plus',      '1',1,3,2,3",
                "'flip',                                'flip',      '3',1,3,1,3", // <2>
                "'one half minus two thirds is',       'minus', '(-1/6)',1,2,2,3"
            } )
----

<1> The operation name is the second value in the csv record, here *times*. Note that you can quote strings, but that is not required.
<2> In the flip operation, the second fraction is ignored, so any legal value is allowed. Here we use the same values for both fractions.



.Test method using the test data
[source,java]
----
void fractionOps( ArgumentsAccessor args ) {
        // read test values
        String message = args.getString( 0 );
        String opName = args.getString( 1 );
        String expected = args.getString( 2 );
        int a = args.getInteger( 3 ); // <1>
        int b = args.getInteger( 4 );
        int c = args.getInteger( 5 );
        int d = args.getInteger( 6 );
        Fraction f1 = frac( a, b ); // <2>
        Fraction f2 = frac( c, d );
        System.out.println( "message = " + message );

        BiFunction<Fraction, Fraction, Fraction> op = ops.get( opName ); // <3>
        Fraction result = op.apply( f1, f2 ); // <4>
        assertThat( result.toString() )
                .as( message )
                .isEqualTo( expected );
    }
----

<1> The fraction parameters a,b,c, and d are captured from the csvrecord. This makes the test method a tad longer, but also more understandable.
<2> The fraction instances are created from a,b,c, and d.
<3> The operation (op) is looked up in the map
<4> Apply the operation, or rather the function and capture the result.

You can apply the same trick of looking up with enums too, even easier, because the enum itself can translate from String to value,
as long as the spelling is exact.

Study the examples above, they might give you inspiration with the exercises coming up and will score you points during the exam.
