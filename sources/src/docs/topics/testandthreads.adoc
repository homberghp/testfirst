=== Test and Threads

Sometime you have to test the cooperation of two 'programs'.

In week 9 you will be programming a simple file transport protocol
using a client and a server. To test the cooperation, you need to have the server running while using the client.
For that, you can use the fact that server and client can run in the same JVM, but on different *threads*.

To do that in a test class you could do start the server before all tests in a test class are execute.
For good measure, shut the server down after all tests have executed.

The examples below are from the sebiftp exercise in week 9.

.start server used by all tests
[source,java]
----
static SebiFtpServer server;

@BeforeAll

public static void startServer() throws IOException {

    server = new SebiFtpServer( new String[]{Integer.toString(16016)} );
    new Thread( () -> {
        try {
            server.start();
        } catch ( IOException ex ) {
            Logger.getLogger( TransferTest.class.getName() ).log( Level.SEVERE, null, ex );
        }

    } ).start();
}

----

.test both via the client
[source,java]
----
// some test code here
SebiFtpClient.main( new String[]{ absolutePath, localFile } );
// some asserts here.
----

.shut the server down
[source,java]
----
@AfterAll
static void stopServer() throws IOException{
    server.stop();
}
