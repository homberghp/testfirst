== Code Coverage in NetBeans IDE

=== What is Code Coverage?

To see if your tests use all the code your write, you can add a plugin to netbeans
that can show so called coverage data. Coverage is the percentage of lines and branches
that is executed, shown in a report and in the IDE.

In this case a red (red background) means the code was not executed.

=== How to install a code coverage plugin in NetBeans

The plugin is called TikiOne JaCoCoverage and can be installed form NetBean's default plugin repository. Read JaCoCoverage as Java Code Coverage.

Use the NetBeans Plugin Dialog to add it to your own installation.
