== Date Time Quirks

[WARNING]
====
Because the way calendars, hours in a day etc is invented by humans, not nature,
data and time calculation has quite some quirks.
====

This also has had effect on the way a Date Time API works.

* Humans invented daylight saving time. The üåû or nature do not care, but it makes
 days between dates a guessing game. Same with leap years. That is why a `java.time.Period` does
 not return the number of days between to dates, but instead the number of years, months and days.
 Say if your Period has a text presentation (by toString()) of *P6Y3M12D* it means that it will return 12 when you call `getDays()`,
 and not something like `6*365+6*30+12`.
* To measure the number of days between two dates you should use `long ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(LocalDate startInclusive , LocalDate endExclusive)`
  which produces the correct number of days between to dates. And that computation is more complex than the simple formula in the previous bullet suggest.
* Finding that in the API is a bit tricky, because the method mentioned is defined in the interface TemporalUnit that is implemented
  by the `ChronoUnit enum`.

.Correct computation of number of days between two dates
[source,java]
----
  long daysBetweenEasterAndPentecost = ChronoUnit.Days.between( easterSunday, pentecost ); //<1>
  assertThat(daysBetweenEasterAndPentecost).isEqualTo( 7 * 7 );
----

<1> Pentecost is the holiday known as Pinksteren in Dutch , Pfingsten in German, Rusalii in Romanian, –ü–µ—Ç–¥–µ—Å–µ—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ in Bulgarian etc.
 It stems from old Greek. So now you know.

=== Special data computations

Sometimes you need to compute a date relative to the end of a month. Hypothetical: last Monday of April
starts May holiday.

.Start of may vacation is last monday of april.
[source,java]
----
    // assume easterSunday is a field.
    LocalDate startOfMayVacation() {
        TemporalAdjuster lastMondayInApril = TemporalAdjusters.lastInMonth( DayOfWeek.MONDAY );
        LocalDate firstOfApril = of( easterSunday.getYear(), Month.APRIL, 1 );
        Temporal adjustInto = lastMondayInApril.adjustInto( firstOfApril );
        // cast fits, because this temporal (interface) instance is a localdate.
        return (LocalDate) adjustInto ;
    }
----

.Same as the above in one long statement. Which is more readable. And understandable?
[source,java]
----
    LocalDate startOfMayVacation() {
        return (LocalDate) TemporalAdjusters.lastInMonth( DayOfWeek.MONDAY ) // <1>
            .adjustInto( of( easterSunday.getYear(), Month.APRIL, 1 ) ); // <2>
    }
----

<1> Get adjuster (and cast)
<2> apply adjuster on date, returning new Temporal.

Remember to use your IDE well. Completion will give some hints.
